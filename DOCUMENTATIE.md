ok perfect, i changed the tracking URI from mlflow.set_tracking_uri("sqlite:///mlflow.db") to mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5001") but i saw somewhere that you needed to use mlflow.set_tracking_uri("sqlite:///mlflow.db") if using docker compose, why don't we need it now? and when do we need it like that?

Great question ‚Äî understanding **when to use `sqlite:///mlflow.db` vs. `http://localhost:5001`** is crucial for MLflow projects, especially when using Docker Compose.


## ‚úÖ What Do These URIs Actually Mean?

### üîπ `sqlite:///mlflow.db`
This refers to a **local SQLite database file** and is used as a **backend store** for MLflow ‚Äî *by the MLflow server*, not your training script.

> **This URI is set in your `mlflow` Docker service.**  
> It's not for clients like `train_streamlined.py`, but for configuring how MLflow stores run metadata.

Example in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
mlflow:
  command: mlflow server \
           --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db \
           --default-artifact-root /mlflow/mlruns \
           --host 0.0.0.0
```

üß† It tells **MLflow server**:  
> "Store metadata (runs, experiments, etc.) in a local SQLite file."

---

### üîπ `http://localhost:5001`
This is the **tracking URI for clients** (like your training script).  
It tells the script:
> ‚ÄúSend all tracking data to the MLflow server running on `localhost:5001`.‚Äù

So in your Python code:
```python
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5001")
```

Means:  
> ‚ÄúConnect to the MLflow server on that address and log the run there.‚Äù

## ‚úÖ Summary of Roles

| URI                            | Used Where             | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sqlite:///mlflow.db`         | In `mlflow` container  | Backend storage (metadata DB)                |
| `http://localhost:5001`       | In training scripts    | Client ‚Üí Server communication for tracking   |

## üö´ When *Not* to Use `sqlite:///mlflow.db` in Code

- If you set this **in your script**, it will attempt to use a **local file DB** (in your dev container or host), and **bypass** your running MLflow server.
- You'll end up with **two separate tracking stores** and a very confusing UI experience.

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

- Use `mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5001")` in your Python code.
- Use `sqlite:///mlflow.db` in Docker Compose (for the MLflow service backend).
- Never use `sqlite:///mlflow.db` in your script unless you're running MLflow in-process and locally (not via the server).
